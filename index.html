		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<img src="assets/images/shila.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="shila">
		<p>I am someone who is mature, candid and who has integrity. Everyday I work to improve myself and my skills which is part of maturing and becoming better at what I do. I take responsibility for my actions and when things go wrong I don't look to outside forces to blame, rather I'm someone who looks at where I can improve upon the next time around. Pointing fingers solves nothing.</p>
		<p>failture will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough. If builders built buildings the way programmers wrote programs, then the first woodpecker that came along wound destroy civilization.
